          <div class="info">
            Our group project is about a site that individuals can unwind by playing a game. The game here resembles a Ping Pong game, however, the extraordinary here is the unique playstyle, a basic ball bouncing game that assists the player with invigorating their brain from upsetting day by keeping the ball ricocheting to procure focuses, no rivalry, just player and the ball. Reward element could be at explicit focuses that arbitrary snags will seem to expand trouble of the game.
           <div class="break"></div>
            For the higher perspective, we need to assemble a little game site that contains different games that are not serious, for no reason in particular and loosen up reason as it were. As a general rule, a site that requests clients register, to save their information and afterward add month-to-month occasion for the player, about games reward highlight.

          <div class="info">
            This venture is significant and intriguing because that most games are about to contest and high award that makes individuals concentrate and exceptional, yet with our undertaking, the primary objective is a 1-player venture all through bunches of games. This will fit in the IT drifts fine and dandy assuming we can scale this site that includes heaps of engineers to deal with every particular game. Besides, a future manager will see that we are equipped for the web advancement region.

            The comparison of the task right currently depends on the conventional Ping Pong game, yet soon everybody will see the interesting side of our undertaking, no aggressive game yet enjoyable to play. Assuming we figure out how proportional our site is to incorporate more scaled-down games, our rival could be y8, an extremely well-known web game for youngsters including heaps of smaller than usual games, yet the thing that matters is that it is serious and for the most part are multiplayer mode. Our venture will chiefly zero in on 1-player and game that main spotlight engaging not rivalry. Additionally, the player will get reward occasion for the game they play, could be more plunders, more elements…

          The primary goal of the project is to determine whether or not a person has experienced mental illness by determining their level of happiness and their Net Emotional Index (NEI), and then to place an emphasis on the solutions and treatments that can be used to alleviate any unfavorable emotions that have been reported by users. In addition to this, it publishes a full-time must-do activity timetable that runs concurrently with the calendar in order to back up that procedure.
          <div class="break"></div>
          In general, raising the value of your "Emotional Index" also raises the primary part of your body's health. This is because mental health plays an indispensable role in gaining resistance, and raising your "Emotional Index" value is one way to do this.
          <div class="break"></div>
          In the end, it is our intention that the website will support and be an effective tool to help people reduce stress so that they can have a more optimistic outlook on life and enjoy it more fully.

          Plan and Progress

        <ul id = "plan_pro" class="list" style="margin-top: 0px; display: none;">
          <li class="geninfo">- Plan:</li>
          <div id="Plan" class="info">
            Our undertaking is separated into three primary stages:
            <div class="break"></div>
            For the first phase, we met face to face to form a team and find an idea for our project as well as decide the tasks and roles for each member. At the beginning, it really took us a long time to come up with an idea because all of us are first-year RMIT students. Our group has thinked about a website involved with the environment which can help people know some methods to reuse, reduce, and recycle their unnecessary things. However, that idea was too simple, and could not be developed later, because our criteria is making a website or an app that is creative and feasible, and can affect positively on the world and human-beings. We see that there are too many people with mental problems, which can change their emotion and lifestyle negatively, so our team decided to create an app that helps people improve their emotions as well as mentality.
            <div class="break"></div>
            The next two phases are designing a prototype for our app, and creating a website that presents our task, and every connected substance. For the first task, we will create this app with three primary functions which are practical and helpful to users, which are suggesting some suitable activities for people, giving happiness scales and line graphs based on users data, and arranging plans for users with a calendar. At this step, Figma will be a perfect tool for IT freshmen like us, and Figma is also user-friendly by using drag and drop. I can say that Figma is very suitable for our project, because our purpose is making people happy and feel comfortable, which means that we need to add colorful elements and joyful images in our app.
            <div class="break"></div>
            For the last step, we would like to make a website that will contain our content, ideas as well as plans of our application, using HTML and CSS. Because all of us just learn about basic HTML and CSS, and we have no experience in web coding, our website is quite simple and has few functions.
            <div class="break"></div>
            As we work our way through the plan and see it through to completion, we will, at the very least, have some experience in the process of constructing a website as well as a basic understanding of how an application or website is crafted. That is to say, when it was all said and done, we possessed a website that displayed moderate content and a prototype of our application. After that, we will be able to carry on with the rest of the development of our project.
          </div>
          <li class="geninfo">- Progress:</li>
          <div id="Progress" class="info">
            With limitations for 4 weeks, Thien and I would manage to manipulate HTML, CSS for showing our contents for the report on our website as well as the prototype, while Hao and Thang would design a prototype with colorful components by Figma. The biggest problem right now is time, and we are too new with web development and web design. If we want to finish this project, we need more time to research as well as sharpen our programming skills. However, we believe that in the near future, we will be able to develop a fully functional website. As we are new to web development as well as web design,  we have to acquire some basic HTML, CSS and study how to utilize Figma.
            <div class="break"></div>
            About the prototype, it needs to be attractive and helpful, so we have referred to some topic-related apps and websites, and finally we were inspired by an app named Mappiness which appeared for a long time with the purpose of doing some research about which things around people affect their happiness most. In spite of possessing the same working principle that collects people’s feelings from simple questions, with a different purpose, we would create a more advanced app which includes eye-catching graphics and user-friendly interface. Moreover, we have changed the name of our app from 2H (Happiness & Health) to THKTemosure, due to the fact that the second name is more fancy and meaningful. THKT represents each member’s name, while “emosure” is emotion measuring, which is able to speak out the aim of our app.  
            <div class="break"></div>
            Since everyone first came up with their own design while learning HTML and CSS on their own, we have updated our content website numerous times. Following careful deliberation, we chose the design that received the most votes and based the design for the entire project page on it.
            <div class="break"></div>
            We strive to finish the report's contents as quickly as possible so that we can post them all on our website before moving on to the presentation.
          </div>
        </ul>

        <!--Roles-->

          Roles
        </div>
        <div id="roles" class="info" style="display: none;">
          Four people make up our team:
          <div class="break"></div>
          Project manager is Thien who oversees the group and evaluates the task to decide what we should accomplish. The main ideas were produced by Thien and Khai, who also designed the website, repaired and improved it as well as wrote the report. Working collaboratively on the PowerPoint presentation and some sections of the report Hao and Thang. Moreover, two of them were assigned to design the prototype of our project. To agree on the idea and clarify certain workplace difficulties that have come up, the four of us must talk.

        <!--Scope and Limits-->

          Scope and Limits
        </div>
        <div id="s_lim" class="info" style="display: none;">
          Because we are first-year students at RMIT and have relatively little expertise in coding, we are unable to develop a program that is finished in its entirety. Even so, we decided to make a simple demo of our application, which included the login page and three main pages, each of which had its own set of goals and limitations. 
          <div class="break"></div>
          The home page will provide users with the option to log in using an existing account, or if they do not currently have an account, they will have the option to establish a new account by providing either an email address or a phone number. Our team is able to design additional features, such as alternatives for logging in via social media, the ability to reset passwords, and a help center.
          <div class="break"></div>
          People are able to engage with two sections that were made on the page titled "How do you feel?" These sections are titled "Feeling" and "Advisors." There will be questions for users to answer in the first part of the section, and based on their responses, the program will provide some acceptable recommendations in the second part of the section, which could assist people in increasing their emotion. In the future, when our expertise in information technology has improved, we will be able to extend the number of questions available and expand the guidance we offer to individuals of a particular personality type.
          <div class="break"></div>
          In order for users to have a better understanding of their current state, they can navigate to the page titled "My happiness," where they will find a happiness scale that ranges from 0 to 10. (0-2: Not very happy; 2-4: Not happy; 4-6: Moderately happy; 6-8: Happy; 8-10: Very happy). In addition, there is a line graph that illustrates the progression of users' emotions over the course of a month, with each line having a color that corresponds to a specific month.
          <div class="break"></div>
          All of the user information will be kept in the "Calendar," which will then handle automatically the "Advisors" activities that are recommended for each day, taking into account the user's condition. They would then have a strategy for the following week, month, or year as a result of this. People will be able to add their own plans to this calendar when we add an area for them to do so in the fully built program.  
        </div>

        <!--Tools and Techs-->

        <div id="tool_tech_t" class="trigger" style="padding-left: 30px;" title="Click to hide content" onclick="toggle_show_and_hide('tool_tech')">

          Tools and Technologies
        </div>
        <div id="tool_tech" class="info" style="display: none;">
          Our project main technologies are HTML, CSS, and JS altogether with some JS framework for the backend (NodeJS) and frontend (ReactJS), as well as a cloud service provider to host our website online. HTML, CSS and JS are all free online, but for the deployment, it is charged each month based on the cloud service provider that we choose, but we will try to demo it using free one associated with Heroku or Netlify.
        </div>

        <!--Testing-->

        <div id="test_t" class="trigger" style="padding-left: 30px;" title="Click to hide content" onclick="toggle_show_and_hide('test')">

          Testing
        </div>
        <div id="test" class="info" style="display: none;">
          Our group will execute the testing stage by playing the game on the different network platform such as Google Chrome, Firefox, Microsoft Edge and on different operating system to check if the game works smoothly with different operating system or not. Additionally, for the game logic there will be three different testers that work in the IT industry for a long time testing the game for us. With their support, we will be able to spot nearly all the bugs in our game even though it just a minor bug. When the testing stages is completed, all the members and testers will have a meeting and determine if the game was developed successful when all the members agreement. Furthermore, the players will be a crucial essence determining the successful of the game by filling in the customers review form.

          Risks
        </div>
        <div id="risk" class="info" style="display: none;">
          It is hard to avoid any risk when starting up and working towards the end of a project. These are 2 risks that we identify and speculate regarding our project:
          <div class="break"></div>
          <ul class="list" style="margin-top: 0px;">
            <li class="geninfo">-	Risk 1: Financial:</li>
            <div class="info">
              Like most forms of software development, the team will make no revenue from the duration of the work itself. Indeed, there are some startup pages such as Kickstarter, but it comes with many risks. It could be that the demo may not reach many people or not many feels interested in it yet. Hence, the ground funding campaign may not be enough to support members during the time. Unlike a lot of other forms, game developers usually make game without guaranteed customer even when the product is completed. The team will usually suffer financial loss during the producing time. However, if the project takes too much time or if the sales forecast was misread or wrong, the team will face even worse loss. As a small team, we will be burdened by time pressure and economic cost during the period of producing this project. We speculated them so we chose to have an adequate scope for this project in order to minimize this risk, but this does not fully eliminate it. If the expenses required to walk through this project to the end are above average starting capital, even if it is a passion project, the opportunity cost could result in the team dissolution.
            </div>
            <li class="geninfo">-	Risk 2: No demand:</li>
            <div class="info">
              As mentioned above, one of the most dangerous risks for a video game is when there is not enough buyer leading to minimum or even no sales. Each project relies on forecasting tools to determine how success the project will be. Demand risk refers to the forecast might not give the accurate prediction. No matter the reason, in an industry built around pushing demand, a project will sink and can lead to studio closure if the scope was too big. While our project is small, we do not have the same marketing power like an entire industry because the project will be constructed ourselves with a fluctuated financial and is mostly fueled more by passion than reason. The fear of no demand towards our project is realistically apprehensive. However, the project had been intended as more of a learning experience rather than creating a product that is globally viral. Although we may experience damage in finance lost, we still manage to learn from the work we have done and bring entertainment to customers even in just a short time.

          In every Wednesday evening, our group meetings take place. Our group meetings usually start when all the members finished their dinner to have the best spirit to dedicate their ideas. If one the members of our group cannot attend the meetings, we will explain for that member the content of that meeting and provide that member with the record of the meeting since we recorded every meeting to watch again to do the task effectively. The meeting usually occurs about three to four hours and the meeting must be organized every week to catch up with the progress of the assignment. In addition, if the problem that we need to solve is important, we will spend more time to solve it together. We usually using Microsoft Teams platform to organize the weekly meetings; besides that, we also use Messenger to discussing and sending documents related to the assignment. Moreover, we keep our assignment on track by using Microsoft Word SharePoint to do the report together since we divided the assignment into smaller pieces and each person will be responsible for some sections. Additionally, we can manage our group process and fix the report on the weekly meeting. As an embodiment, all the members could see that who have completed their tasks and who didn’t have their task fulfilled yet. Before the weekly meetings, every member in our group will write down what they have done in the previous week, what they want to contribute such as any new ideas, suggestion for the report and website or even the further development of our game.
