      <dd>"Since this is my first leadership role in a university setting, I have learned much about project management. I am meticulous and organized, and I take notes throughout meetings to document the decisions made, the duties given, and the dates of future meetings. I worry a lot about how the team members operate. I'm empathetic, friendly, and eager to listen and serve as the team counselor. Due to all of these factors, my project is doing well, yet I still have some challenges at work. My buddy was pressured to do this on time because certain specific assignments had limited deadlines.</dd>
      <dd>Additionally, I only sometimes properly review my teammates' work after they've completed it, which causes some of their work to fall short of the standard. Therefore, my group project's quality will increase if I sharpen my management abilities under these circumstances. My teammate's ability to pick things up quickly impressed me; even though they were university freshmen, they performed their duties above and beyond my expectations."</dd>

      <dd>"I am really glad to say that our group has been working very well to finish this project, and our teamwork was one of the factors that contributed to our success. I have a great appreciation of each members’ contribution and cooperation. Although we had to work online most of the time, due to being far away from school of one member, I saw that they had a meritorious responsibility and spirit of making an effort to complete the given tasks.</dd>
      <dd>Moreover, I admit that I have learned a lot in this project, which was from my friends, my teachers, and my own. In this project, it’s really important to study on your own, so I forced myself to search for new things every day, which helped me to complete my tasks greatly. In addition, I also got acquainted with time management and work-life balance. I'm confident that I'll be able to perform better on my further projects if I work tirelessly and with a great deal of enthusiasm."</dd>

      <dt style="color:rgb(255, 81, 0); font-weight: bold; padding-left: 35px">Thang:</dt>
      <dd>"Through this project, I have a very good team and always help each other in everything. Although the work has been divided among each other, the team members still answer all questions for each other to push each other through the fast-paced process. In addition, Thien is also a person who helped us to know the figma software, which helps us to optimize a lot of time to complete our project. In particular, we have worked together and completed the project together. It is a very fortunate thing that I feel. That shows the efficiency of each member who contributed to this project, and completed the work as quickly as possible. My hope is that my teammates can work together in the future."</dd>

      <dt style="color: rgb(255, 81, 0); font-weight: bold; padding-left: 35px">Hao:</dt>
      <dd>"The project of our team is developing a software that is named “Emosure” which stands for Emotional measurement. It’s a prototype software that all of us put countless effort into. It has the main purpose to give results and extract suggestions for those who encounter mental illnesses.</dd>
      <dd>We spent weeks working on the project. The division of the tasks itself went really well, as everyone worked hard even though there were so many examinations up ahead. I have responsibility for the U.I and Software prototype, Khai and Thien coded the whole HTML web and pushed it to GitHub, while Thang designed a slide to present on the board. At first everything is quite well-going, but after a week we decided to push up the speed of the project because it already been late, but actually it’s not stressful at all as we have more time to communicate with each other and have time to sat down and to talked about our family background which brought us so much closer, it the most value time. The day before the deadline, I encountered a problem which was the downgrading of image and icon resolution after I executed it in FIGMA. It’s not difficult to fix but it took lots of hours to think about the solution. Finally, I used a website called “Remini”, a website that enhances the index upscale of an image, then I felt satisfied after fixing it. Lastly, the presentation went smoothly and all involved a precise direction of the topic.</dd>
      <dd>During my work experience with the team, I had the good fortune to learn and experience many various aspects of what goes into a project, including the basic process of how a project is first planned, developed, and finished, as well as how much effort and detail goes into every stage. Even though this is just a prototype project, I still have big dreams such as a Front-end developer and Web UI designer. Last but not least, to accomplish great things, I would like to improve numerous skills in the upcoming projects, such as avoiding wasting too much time on minor errors and learning more about the hardware."</dd>
