          After much deliberation, we came to the decision that the new name for our group should be THKTemosure. The previous name, 2H, will no longer be used. This new name, in our opinion, is not only more meaningful but also more elegant. The acronym THKT stands for the initial letter of each member's name, and the word "emosure" refers to the process of measuring emotions; together, these two words convey the purpose of our software.

              Although Thien is only a first-year RMIT IT student and has little actual coding expertise, he is extremely passionate about studying and using computers. Additionally, Thien wants to learn about the emotions of those around him, thus he is motivated to contribute to a project that deals with human emotion. He chose to be project leader in order to gain additional management experience for an IT project. Thien will make sure that the weekly project status, quality assurance of project deliverables, and task distribution to each team member are all running smoothly. His goals in taking this course are to gain more practical coding experience, apply his academic knowledge, and comprehend the intricacies of an IT project better.

              I used to have a dream to become a mental therapist. In my mind, I am always curious about the emotional level of people these days when everything seems in a rush. Besides, having artificial intelligence implemented in order to estimate the happiness level of an individual is a brilliant idea in my opinion. Afterwards, I want to develop a website to calculate emotional status through facial expressions. Hence, we have a conscious knowledge about an individual's psychological system so that it’s easier to find a valid cure for psychotherapy. My role is to debut the software, running and find out solutions if something wrong happened. I also have responsibility for scheduling timetables of the project, managing the activity orders in the most valid way to produce a fine report.

              When I hear an idea from one of my team members talking about an idea is an app that can measure how happy that person is currently. Then I was surprised and very excited about this project this time with my team. Because I feel that I can measure the emotional level of people around me when they work with me or maybe my customers and can tell if they like my product or not. This can also help your store get better at getting your customer reviews back. I am a person who loves to find good things on my own and wants to achieve what I want. I often spend a lot of time looking for new ideas and topics to help myself gain new knowledge. My role in this project is to find the necessary information for my team to fill in the required information and give the necessary ideas to the team.

              I have a lot of things to do in my free time, but I love reading books, especially psychology books. Because my second interest right after technology is human psychology, I want to do a lot of research on people’s minds. Moreover, I also want to give people with mental problems a hand. With that spirit, I feel this project is really meaningful for me, so I hope me and my teammates can use this project to help as many people as possible. I am very excited when I work with numbers and information, so my major is data analyst. In this project, I would analyze data and give founded recommendations, using knowledge about data visualization tools (Power BI, Tableau,…), statistics and some programming languages such as Python, SQL.

            In this assignment, we have done numerous work together because we are first-year students at RMIT, so we only have a little experience in the IT project. Therefore, we were always ready to help each other when they struggled with their task, so every task was done on time. We divided the task fairly and finished it ahead of the deadline time. Because this is the first time we have had a chance to work together, there were some difficulties. However we hope we can soon work as a group again and improve our skills together.

            All members in the group share an identical hobby that we all wish to become a software engineer. Nevertheless, each person has their own strengths and weaknesses so our position in this field is quite different. In depth, I am Hao, I am the first member, and I  have a strong ambition to design, visualize and color-grade with a particular object so I always want to work as a front-end developer, both mobile or website are appropriate to me. In contrast, the second member, Khai is the one who have a mathematical thinking, he’s always involving himself into challenging code exercises for example, picking a word in an enormous paragraph by using dictionary function, he well-learned with digits and code format so that’s the main reason why he wants to become a back-end coder. The third member is Thien, also having a logical mindset. Thien can learn about data statistics and visualization all day, and he wishes to be a data analyst. Thang is the last member who is interested in cracking and jailbreaking into game and software, he spent hours learning about Real-time threat elimination so it’s understandable that he wants to work as a cyber-security analyst.
