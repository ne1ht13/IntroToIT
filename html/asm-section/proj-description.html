          <div class="info">
            Our initiative is called 2H (Happiness & Heath). We made the decision to start this project in order to improve the lifestyle and happiness of modern people. First and foremost, we want to make it clear that our project is intended for those who are unhappy and bored with their current circumstances and can help people with social problems improve their health. Additionally, it motivates individuals to venture outside and take in the beauty that surrounds them. Users of this program would find a number of its features to be helpful. By informing the app of their plans from Monday through Sunday, users can alter their daily routines to ones that are healthier or happier. The app will provide feedback and improve the schedule in response to user needs after analysing and assessing the data (we utilise AI for this stage). People only need to respond to a few simple questions from the app, like "How do you feel now?," "What is the weather today?," "Who you're with?," etc., if they are bored, sad, or unsure of what to do after a long day at work. It will provide users with some beneficial healing advice along with a happiness scale. Users will also be given a plot to follow the changes in their mood and health over time.
          </div>
          <li class="geninfo">Motivation:</li>
          <div class="info">
            Do people still feel joyful in this driven-by-technology era? What causes them to feel happy? And what can we do to make them happier? As you can see, modern individuals nowadays have a heavy workload at work and at home, which leaves them with less time for rest or family time, which can cause stress and exhaustion. However, some people spend too much time indoors using their high-end devices all day rather than going outside, which can have a bad impact on their health and lead to issues including mental disorders, obesity, and eye issues. Possibly because they are unable to discover their own joy outside, the environment is too congested, noisy, or polluting, or staying at home is more alluring. In light of all the aforementioned occurrences, it follows that happiness and health will generally decline. Therefore, we made the decision to develop an app that functions as an analyst or advisor. This program will assess and provide a happiness scale based on users' data inputs (such as their feelings, location, weather, everyday items, etc.). It will then offer some suggestions on how users can increase their happiness.
          </div>
          <li class="geninfo">Landscape:</li>
          <div class="info">
            The software process identifies emerging technologies that are relevant to a group's long-term innovation goals.  In the future we can upgrade the software to a facial expression estimation so that it can be implemented into criminal investigation, for instance we can detect the lie and truth of a suspect through their face emotion or most important we can use it to be a calculating tool of treatment for mental illnesses patients, with all of the value we all wish that the software could be a product of Medical Application and widely used by medical centers. Lastly, brand trademark transfer is also possible to make a huge growth in financial account.

        <div id="Aim" class="info" style="display: none;">
          The primary goal of the project is to determine whether or not a person has experienced mental illness by determining their level of happiness and their Net Emotional Index (NEI), and then to place an emphasis on the solutions and treatments that can be used to alleviate any unfavorable emotions that have been reported by users. In addition to this, it publishes a full-time must-do activity timetable that runs concurrently with the calendar in order to back up that procedure.
          <div class="break"></div>
          In general, raising the value of your "Emotional Index" also raises the primary part of your body's health. This is because mental health plays an indispensable role in gaining resistance, and raising your "Emotional Index" value is one way to do this.
          <div class="break"></div>
          In the end, it is our intention that the website will support and be an effective tool to help people reduce stress so that they can have a more optimistic outlook on life and enjoy it more fully.

          Plan and Progress
        </div>
        <ul id = "plan_pro" class="list" style="margin-top: 0px; display: none;">
          <li class="geninfo">- Plan:</li>
          <div id="Plan" class="info">
            Our undertaking is separated into three primary stages:
            <div class="break"></div>
            For the first phase, we met face to face to form a team and find an idea for our project as well as decide the tasks and roles for each member. At the beginning, it really took us a long time to come up with an idea because all of us are first-year RMIT students. Our group has thinked about a website involved with the environment which can help people know some methods to reuse, reduce, and recycle their unnecessary things. However, that idea was too simple, and could not be developed later, because our criteria is making a website or an app that is creative and feasible, and can affect positively on the world and human-beings. We see that there are too many people with mental problems, which can change their emotion and lifestyle negatively, so our team decided to create an app that helps people improve their emotions as well as mentality.
            <div class="break"></div>
            The next two phases are designing a prototype for our app, and creating a website that presents our task, and every connected substance. For the first task, we will create this app with three primary functions which are practical and helpful to users, which are suggesting some suitable activities for people, giving happiness scales and line graphs based on users data, and arranging plans for users with a calendar. At this step, Figma will be a perfect tool for IT freshmen like us, and Figma is also user-friendly by using drag and drop. I can say that Figma is very suitable for our project, because our purpose is making people happy and feel comfortable, which means that we need to add colorful elements and joyful images in our app.
            <div class="break"></div>
            For the last step, we would like to make a website that will contain our content, ideas as well as plans of our application, using HTML and CSS. Because all of us just learn about basic HTML and CSS, and we have no experience in web coding, our website is quite simple and has few functions.
            <div class="break"></div>
            As we work our way through the plan and see it through to completion, we will, at the very least, have some experience in the process of constructing a website as well as a basic understanding of how an application or website is crafted. That is to say, when it was all said and done, we possessed a website that displayed moderate content and a prototype of our application. After that, we will be able to carry on with the rest of the development of our project.
          </div>
          <li class="geninfo">- Progress:</li>
          <div id="Progress" class="info">
            With limitations for 4 weeks, Thien and I would manage to manipulate HTML, CSS for showing our contents for the report on our website as well as the prototype, while Hao and Thang would design a prototype with colorful components by Figma. The biggest problem right now is time, and we are too new with web development and web design. If we want to finish this project, we need more time to research as well as sharpen our programming skills. However, we believe that in the near future, we will be able to develop a fully functional website. As we are new to web development as well as web design,  we have to acquire some basic HTML, CSS and study how to utilize Figma.
            <div class="break"></div>
            About the prototype, it needs to be attractive and helpful, so we have referred to some topic-related apps and websites, and finally we were inspired by an app named Mappiness which appeared for a long time with the purpose of doing some research about which things around people affect their happiness most. In spite of possessing the same working principle that collects people’s feelings from simple questions, with a different purpose, we would create a more advanced app which includes eye-catching graphics and user-friendly interface. Moreover, we have changed the name of our app from 2H (Happiness & Health) to THKTemosure, due to the fact that the second name is more fancy and meaningful. THKT represents each member’s name, while “emosure” is emotion measuring, which is able to speak out the aim of our app.  
            <div class="break"></div>
            Since everyone first came up with their own design while learning HTML and CSS on their own, we have updated our content website numerous times. Following careful deliberation, we chose the design that received the most votes and based the design for the entire project page on it.
            <div class="break"></div>
            We strive to finish the report's contents as quickly as possible so that we can post them all on our website before moving on to the presentation.
          </div>
        </ul>

        <!--Roles-->
        <div id="roles_t" class="trigger" style="padding-left: 30px;" title="Click to hide content" onclick="toggle_show_and_hide('roles')">
          <div id="roles_tri" class="cont_tri" style="display: inline-block;">&#8227;</div>
          Roles
        </div>
        <div id="roles" class="info" style="display: none;">
          Four people make up our team:
          <div class="break"></div>
          Project manager is Thien who oversees the group and evaluates the task to decide what we should accomplish. The main ideas were produced by Thien and Khai, who also designed the website, repaired and improved it as well as wrote the report. Working collaboratively on the PowerPoint presentation and some sections of the report Hao and Thang. Moreover, two of them were assigned to design the prototype of our project. To agree on the idea and clarify certain workplace difficulties that have come up, the four of us must talk.
        </div>

        <!--Scope and Limits-->

        <div id="s_lim_t" class="trigger" style="padding-left: 30px;" title="Click to hide content" onclick="toggle_show_and_hide('s_lim')">
          <div id="s_lim_tri" class="cont_tri" style="display: inline-block;">&#8227;</div>
          Scope and Limits
        </div>
        <div id="s_lim" class="info" style="display: none;">
          Because we are first-year students at RMIT and have relatively little expertise in coding, we are unable to develop a program that is finished in its entirety. Even so, we decided to make a simple demo of our application, which included the login page and three main pages, each of which had its own set of goals and limitations. 
          <div class="break"></div>
          The home page will provide users with the option to log in using an existing account, or if they do not currently have an account, they will have the option to establish a new account by providing either an email address or a phone number. Our team is able to design additional features, such as alternatives for logging in via social media, the ability to reset passwords, and a help center.
          <div class="break"></div>
          People are able to engage with two sections that were made on the page titled "How do you feel?" These sections are titled "Feeling" and "Advisors." There will be questions for users to answer in the first part of the section, and based on their responses, the program will provide some acceptable recommendations in the second part of the section, which could assist people in increasing their emotion. In the future, when our expertise in information technology has improved, we will be able to extend the number of questions available and expand the guidance we offer to individuals of a particular personality type.
          <div class="break"></div>
          In order for users to have a better understanding of their current state, they can navigate to the page titled "My happiness," where they will find a happiness scale that ranges from 0 to 10. (0-2: Not very happy; 2-4: Not happy; 4-6: Moderately happy; 6-8: Happy; 8-10: Very happy). In addition, there is a line graph that illustrates the progression of users' emotions over the course of a month, with each line having a color that corresponds to a specific month.
          <div class="break"></div>
          All of the user information will be kept in the "Calendar," which will then handle automatically the "Advisors" activities that are recommended for each day, taking into account the user's condition. They would then have a strategy for the following week, month, or year as a result of this. People will be able to add their own plans to this calendar when we add an area for them to do so in the fully built program.  
        </div>

        <!--Risks-->
        
        <div id="risk_t" class="trigger" style="padding-left: 30px;" title="Click to hide content" onclick="toggle_show_and_hide('risk')">
          <div id="risk_tri" class="cont_tri" style="display: inline-block;">&#8227;</div>
          Risks
        </div>
        <div id="risk" class="info" style="display: none;">
          It is challenging to eliminate all risk when a project is only getting started or is nearing completion. Regarding our project, we detect and hypothesize the following 2 risks:
          <div class="break"></div>
          <ul class="list" style="margin-top: 0px;">
            <li class="geninfo">-	Risk 1: Financial:</li>
            <div class="info">
              If our team wants to keep the software updated, we will have a difficult time doing so given that our app is a non-profit project. When development of this app is finally finished at some point in the not too distant future, it will be made available to users as a free download on the App Store, CH Play, and possibly other digital distribution channels for programs. Because our team is really enthusiastic about this endeavor, and because its ultimate goal is to make people's feelings better, we will require financial support to see it through. The goal of our plan to fund this app is to seek financial contributions from users of the app so that individuals will be able to assist us in maintaining this project. In addition to that, we are working with a few other firms in the hopes of receiving sponsorship and financial support through advertising. On the other hand, it was not possible to reach a large number of people due to the fact that it is not initially popular and might not satisfy the desire of consumers. Because of this, there is a possibility that we will have to continue spending our money on the software, or there will be the danger of having to terminate the crew.
            </div>
            <li class="geninfo">-	Risk 2: Useless recommendations:</li>
            <div class="info">
              The function of our software that is most significant is the one that makes suggestions for healthful activities that people can do to improve their mood. For this reason, we need to conduct a significant amount of research on the mental and emotional processes of people in order to develop an AI that is capable of providing users with recommendations that are both accurate and appropriate. Due to the fact that we have never worked on a project in this industry before, the documentation for our app may be lacking if we do not have a comprehensive understanding of this sphere. We are concerned that individuals may not be provided with the appropriate guidance, which may result in the fact that they may experience boredom and lose faith in our application, because they don't feel better after using the app. Our team needs to acquire a profound understanding of this scientific field in order to reduce the likelihood of this risk, which will ultimately contribute to the success of our project.
            </div>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <!--Group processes and communications-->

          Group processes and communications
        </div>
        <div id="gr_com" class="info" style="display: none;">
          One meeting is required for each iteration of the Sprint (weekly). During this meeting, at the absolute least, we are going to be able to do the following:
          <div class="break"></div>
          1. Reflect on the previous iteration of Sprint and make a list of what went well and what could be made better.
          <div class="break"></div>
          2. Sprint planning: Depending on the state of our Product backlog and Sprint backlog, we will decide how to modify the timeline in the section that came before it. Specifically, we will decide how to: postpone feature, cancel feature, scale up/down project scope, start early, reassign tasks, make hot patch, etc. The Sprint backlog will be the deliverable from this conference. We won't be doing daily scrum meetings like you would see in a traditional Scrum implementation. On the other hand, any member of the team is free to convene an unexpected meeting if they believe one is required.
          <div class="break"></div>
          Because we feel that face-to-face communication is the most effective way to create the best possible results, we have decided to give this kind of interaction higher priority and to hold meetings in this format once every two weeks. On the off chance that the situation calls for it, we will hold online meetings on the secondary communication channel that is hosted on our Discord server. Last but not least, for expedited communication, we use Facebook Messenger.
